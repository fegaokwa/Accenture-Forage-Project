<h2>Description</h2>
<br>
Social Buzz is a fictional social media company in San Francisco where content takes center stage. Unlike other companies that use traditional likes/dislikes, Social Buzz gives users over 100 ways to react to content. 

Over the last 5 years, Social Buzz has grown enormously and reached over 500 million active monthly users with over 100K content posted daily. 

Social Buzz has reached out to Accenture as they plan to IPO within a year, and they need expertise in analyzing the massive unstructured data they produce daily from users.

As an Analyst at Accenture, we're tasked with cleaning and analyzing data from 3 datasets - Content, Reactions, and ReactionTypes and highlighting the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.
